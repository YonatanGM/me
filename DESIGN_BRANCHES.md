## My Recommendations

### For Job Hunting (Technical Artist roles):
**‚Üí `design/refined-current`** or **`design/minimal-gallery`**

These balance professionalism with personality. Studios want clean, navigable portfolios.

### For Personal Expression:
**‚Üí `design/digital-garden`** or **`design/dark-bold`**

These have more character and make you memorable.

### For Maximum Impact:
**‚Üí `design/dark-bold`**

Bold choice that will definitely get noticed. Risk: might be too much for conservative studios.

### Safest Choice:
**‚Üí `design/refined-current`**

All the improvements without changing your existing direction.

## Questions to Ask Yourself

- Does this design represent my aesthetic sensibility?
- Would a hiring manager understand my work immediately?
- Does it feel like "me"?
- Is it too safe? Too risky?
- Does the design support the work, or distract from it?
